## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Architecture

MovieTunnel was designed using MVVM architecture as a design pattern. I developed by protocol oriantation rules and SOLID princibles as much as possible. All ViewModels has a protocol. You can see ability of Viewmodels on Protocols. Page designs were generally made with tableViews and CollectionView in order to have a responsive design.
